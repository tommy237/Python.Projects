Python-driven projects for fun

### The Salesman — _(aug 2025)_
>This first project was created back in August 2025, and in under a couple of days, represents the Rock, Paper, Scissors game as referred in the beginning of the _Squid Game_ season 2 show. This, however, the player and bot get to randomize the bullet (a.k.a. re-roll the cylinder), as opposed to the main show.
* >Uses the terminal for game display
* >>The bot is presented as a challenger, but still possible enough to win against them. They also decide like the player when it comes to their responses

### Red Light, Green Light — _(sept 2025)_
>This next project is also involved in the _Squid Game_ series. The player would have to type the entire response while being mindful about the displaying light, indicating when to stop. 
* >>As opposed to the previous project, this one uses a GUI, because the terminal cannot print and read input at the same time on the same line.
